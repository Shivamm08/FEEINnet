**FEEINnet: Feature-Enhanced Edge-INverse attention network for skin lesion segmentation**

## ðŸ“„ Paper Abstract
Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is one of the most aggressive and deadly
forms of cancer with its incidence rising globally. Early detection is crucial for
improving survival rates, but the traditional dermatoscopy method is a highly
time-consuming and subjective process. To resolve this issue, we propose a
novel Feature-Enhanced Edge-INverse attention network (FEEINnet) model
that helps to segment the skin lesion region more accurately. FEEINnet consists
of three sub-networks: Feature Enhanced Mechanism (FEM) learns and
extracts the fine-grained enhanced features from informative channels, the
Edge Attention Mechanism (EAM) helps to precisely identify the edges of
the lesion region and the INverse Attention Mechanism (INAM) generates
inverse attention maps which emphasize the less confident or ambiguous regions
thereby increasing the segmentation accuracy iteratively. These three
sub-networks collectively help to improve feature extraction, enhance boundary
detection, and refine segmentation maps, even in challenging scenarios
with varying lesion sizes, shapes and pigmentation. FEEINnet consistently
outperforms existing models, achieving a F1-score of 95.55%, 95.53%, and
94.52%; Intersection over Union (IoU) of 92.76%, 92.43%, and 91.34%; and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 94.63%, 93.51%, and 91.85%
on the Human Against Machine 10000 (HAM10000), Pedro Hispano Hospital
(PH2), and International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC2018)
datasets, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed
model has a greater ability to segment complex skin lesions more accurately.
